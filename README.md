# Accessible-Mock-Up

## Description 
For our first challenge I have created a mock up web-page that practices accessibility. This was done by adding in correct semantic elements to replace divs, updating the CSS file sheet to display correct classes, and then updated the HTML file sheet with correct class names. I also added in comments to the CSS and HTML sheet to reflect the changed I made. My motivation for this project was to be able to practice CSS skills, apply them, and be able to produce a quality project using learned material from Week 1 of the coding bootcamp.

## Installation
To install the webpage, code had to be cloned from the challenge guidelines. So, that must be completed first. Then, you follow the repository cloning/git pushing steps. 

## Usage 
This accessible mock up can be used to practice beginner web page designing with CSS. Specifically, how to use semantic elements within your code.
