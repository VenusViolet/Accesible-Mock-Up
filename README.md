# Accessible-Mock-Up

## Description 
For our first challenge I have created a mock up web-page that practices accessibility. My motivation for this project was to be able to practice CSS skills, apply them, and be able to produce a quality project using learned material from Weel 1 of the coding bootcamp.

## Installation
To install the webpage, code had to be cloned from the challenge guidelines. So, that must be completed first. Then, you follow the repository cloning/git pushing steps. 

## Usage 
This accessible mock up can be used to practice beginner web page designing with CSS. Specifically, how to use semantic elements within your code. 

## Credits
Nico Westgard reviewed and helped with the coding process.
